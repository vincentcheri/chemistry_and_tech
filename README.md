# chemistry_and_tech
in this repo i try to apply my programming skills in chemistry. Just to improve my problem solving skills.

periodictable.c can be compiled to anyfile name of your choice or the normal a.out executable file.

Nothing serious here just a simple data structure which is an array and index to element stuff. I know scanf is not the best way to go about this,
but will make some changes in the future :).

you can add more light by reaching me at vj9783@gmail.com.
